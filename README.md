# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail customer dataset to understand shopping behavior, spending patterns, customer loyalty, and purchasing preferences. The analysis transforms raw transactional data into actionable business insights using Python.

---

##  Objectives
- Analyze customer spending patterns across age groups and gender
- Identify high-value customer segments and loyalty trends
- Understand the impact of discounts and subscriptions on purchases
- Examine product, size, color, and category preferences
- Provide data-driven insights to support marketing and business decisions

---

##  Dataset Summary
- Total Records: 3,900 customers
- Features: 16 (Demographics, purchase behavior, ratings, and preferences)
- Missing Values: None
- Duplicate Records: None
- Data Quality: Clean and analysis-ready

---

##  Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Converted raw purchase data into analysis-ready numerical format
- Created meaningful age groups to enable demographic analysis
- Validated data consistency and integrity across all features

---

##  Key Analysis & Insights

### Customer Demographics & Spending
- Customer spending remains relatively stable across age groups
- Mid-age customers (26–55) generate slightly higher average revenue
- Male customers form the dominant user base

### Product & Inventory Insights
- Medium (M) and Large (L) sizes account for the majority of purchases
- Product demand varies significantly by location and category

### Loyalty & Subscription Behavior
- Subscription customers demonstrate higher repeat purchase behavior
- Loyal customers contribute more consistently to overall revenue

### Discounts & Payment Preferences
- Majority of purchases occur without discounts, indicating strong brand value
- Payment methods are evenly distributed, requiring multi-channel support

### Customer Satisfaction
- Higher review ratings correlate with increased repeat purchases
- Customer experience plays a key role in long-term loyalty
